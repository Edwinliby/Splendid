                                                    Squeegees are the go-to tool for window cleaning, designed to remove water and dirt from the glass surface efficiently.
                                                    They consist of a handle and a flexible rubber blade. Choose a squeegee with a comfortable grip and replaceable blades for optimal performance. <br />
                                                    <b>Technique:</b>Start at the top corner of the window and use a smooth, overlapping motion to pull the squeegee down the glass. Wipe the blade with a lint-free cloth after each stroke to avoid streaks.

                                                    For high or hard-to-reach windows, extension poles are indispensable. These adjustable poles allow you to reach heights safely and efficiently, minimizing the need for ladders.
                                                    Please be sure to look for lightweight and durable poles that can be securely attached to squeegees or other cleaning tools. <br />
